#README.md

This repo includes code for an interactive sketching application made in Android Studio. This sketching applications contains
features such as a color picker via the associated seekbars, three brush sizes accessible via the radio buttons, as well as a 
seek bar which controls the opacity of the lines being drawn. Additionally, a clear button is available in the botom right corner
which allows the user to erase the drawing from their canvas. One additional feature of the application is the gradient generator.
There are two distinct buttons which do this. The single question mark generates you a random three color gradient that can be used
repeatedly as you draw. The triple question mark generates you a random three color gradient that will change every time the user 
draws a new path on the canvas (lifts their finger off the screen).
